Hello, everyone! Welcome to the mind of ai! This is my first time blogging, but I've created a lot of article before (back from college, atleast lol). This is really amazing for me, because I've been sharing bunch of awesome things about Microsoft Technology, especially Mobile .NET Development through talks, but I believe that I can share more with creating articles quickly. Another thing that I really love to do is to help other developers with their mobile development issues. 

The idea here is that I want to share my knowledge about Mobile .NET Technologies, especially Xamarin.Forms. This blog will have posts about my experiences, best practices, and thoughts about Mobile .NET Development, my graphic designs, and my opinions about the happenings in different sports. Also, probably, some of my personal thoughts.

I'm really excited to share a lot things about mobile. Hopefully, this will help a lot of developers and enthusiasts out there. See you around, geeks!
