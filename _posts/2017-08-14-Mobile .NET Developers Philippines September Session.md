You are **NOT required** to bring your laptop, but for a better experience, we recommend that you follow and simulate what the speakers' will demo.

**(Optional) For Xamarin Development, here are the hardware and software requirements:**

**Hardware:** https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/requirements/
**Software:** developer.xamarin.com
Pre-requisites for using Xamarin. Xamarin products rely upon the platform SDKs from Apple and Google to target iOS or Android, so our system requirements match theirs.

Hopefully, we can continue this in a monthly basis. Especially, because we already have a sponsor for October! This will be a great opportunity for Microsoft to spread the latest technologies and teach students and professionals how to develop applications using their Mobile .NET technologies. Foods and Drinks will be served as always, so see you there!
