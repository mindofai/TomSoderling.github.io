So, I'm already kinda late with this. It's been almost 3 weeks since Build 2017 happened in Seattle and I just finished watching some of the highlights on [https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017](Channel 9), especially all the things relevant to Xamarin and Mobile .NET. I've read that Xamarin had a bunch of sessions where they announce awesome stuff and I was really interested and excited about a couple of things, namely Xamarin Live Player, Visual Studio Mobile Center, .NET Standard and Fluent Design. I will write a different article about other the other three, but we'll start talking about Xamarin Live Player.

Visual Studio 2017's brand-new Xamarin Live Player for Android and iOS allows you to write, execute, and debug your Xamarin application continuously on an actual iOS or Android device straight from the IDE. It has the traditional development cycle where you write-compile-run-debug, but it's so much faster. But, what I loved about it is that it has a live previewer mode where your code is automatically compiled and deployed per-view basis continuously into your actual device. It's pretty awesome, though, this is not new to me, since Gorilla Player almost identically does the same stuff, but I prefer Xamarin Live Player since the setup is much easier.
