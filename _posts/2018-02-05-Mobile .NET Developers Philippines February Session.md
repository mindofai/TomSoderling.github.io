(Optional) For Xamarin Development, here are the hardware and software requirements:

Hardware: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/requirements/
Software: developer.xamarin.com
Pre-requisites for using Xamarin. Xamarin products rely upon the platform SDKs from Apple and Google to target iOS or Android, so our system requirements match theirs.
