Finally! I'm inviting everyone to come and join the Mobile .NET Developers - Philippines for a hands-on technical training session geared towards mobile developers to deliver first class mobile experiences and drive business transformation with Mobile DevOps.
Explore Mobile DevOps with free training courses from MoNDPH's local community members. Then, after lunch, get the opportunity to put new knowledge into practice by trying out Visual Studio Team Services and Visual Studio Mobile Center to mobilize your project with access to a world-class, end-to-end lifecycle solution that has tools for every stage of Mobile DevOps.
This FREE event will be held on Saturday, July 15, 2017, 8:00AM - 5:00PM in the Visayas and Mindanao rooms of Microsoft Philippines, 8th Floor, 6750 Makati Ave., Makati City, Philippines.
