I have finally organized an event and it's an awesome feeling for me. I'm inviting everyone to come and join the **Mobile .NET Developers - Philippines** for a hands-on technical training session geared towards mobile developers to deliver first class mobile experiences and drive business transformation with Mobile DevOps.

Explore Mobile DevOps with free training courses from MoNDPH's local community members. Then, after lunch, get the opportunity to put new knowledge into practice by trying out Visual Studio Team Services and Visual Studio Mobile Center to mobilize your project with access to a world-class, end-to-end lifecycle solution that has tools for every stage of Mobile DevOps.

In this **FREE technical training session**, we're going to have:

**Michael John T. Pe√±a, Senior Consultant @ Readify, Microsoft MVP, Xamarin MVP, Xamarin Certified Developer** will talk about **Opportunities in Mobile DevOps**

**Christian Nicolas Z. Pascua, Junior Software Developer @ Clink IT Solutions** will talk about **VSTS: Source Control Management**

**Bryan Anthony Garcia, Software Engineer @ Avanade, Mobile .NET Developer, Xamarin Community Blogger** will talk about **Visual Studio Mobile Center's Lifecycle Service (Build - Test - Distribute)**

**Nathaniel Brion Sison, Software Developer @ Smart Communications, Xamarin Certified Developer** will talk about **Visual Studio Mobile Center's Monitoring Service (Crash and Analytics)**

**Mark Deanil Vicente, Corporate Software Developer and Development Lead @ Any Network Systems Inc.** will talk about **Azure Mobile App's Push Notification Service**

Nope, this isn't gonna happen monthly YET. But, I promise that this will be the first of many. This will be a great opportunity for Microsoft to spread the latest technologies and teach students and professionals how to develop applications using their Mobile .NET technologies.
